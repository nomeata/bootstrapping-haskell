This directory contains GNU Emacs support for editing Haskell files.
We don't yet have a fancy editing mode, but haskell.el contains stuff
for running Haskell as an inferior process from Emacs with key bindings
for evaluating code from buffers, etc.  Look at the comments in haskell.el
for more information.
