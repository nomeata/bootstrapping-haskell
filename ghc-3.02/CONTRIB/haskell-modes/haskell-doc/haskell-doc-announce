Fellow Haskell Hackers,

This is the first official release of haskell-doc, an emacs mode that
allows you to look-up the type of a Haskell function by doing nothing for
at least 0.5 seconds. It is implemented as an emacs minor mode, so if you
don't believe in emacs, please ignore this email (and mercy to your soul :-) 

Personally, I hate to leaf through reference manuals just to look for the
type of a prelude function for the Haskell version of the day. Having it
online as web page or info file is better, but you still have to leave your
current buffer. When using haskell-doc a kind-of "emacs demon process" is
installed that regularly checks the Haskell id under the cursor and, if it
is a function, displays the type in the echo area. You can turn the mode on
or off by using CTRL-c CTRL-o if you use one of the supported haskell modes.
For more details check the `Features' section.

Downloading:
============

You can get the elisp code from:
 /ftp@ftp.dcs.gla.ac.uk:/pub/glasgow-fp/authors/Hans_Loidl/Elisp/haskell-doc.el
or if you prefer URLs
 ftp://ftp.dcs.gla.ac.uk/pub/glasgow-fp/authors/Hans_Loidl/Elisp/haskell-doc.el

The page is also reachable via my homepage http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~hwloidl

Installation:
=============

Put the file into a directory on your load-path, byte compile it and then
put the following into your .emacs file:

  (autoload 'turn-on-haskell-doc-mode "haskell-doc" nil t)

and depending on the major mode you use for your Haskell programs:
  (add-hook 'hugs-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-doc-mode)    ; hugs-mode
or
  (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-doc-mode) ; haskell-mode

If you do not use a special haskell mode, you can still use haskell-doc. 
In this case you have to type 
  M-x turn-on-haskell-doc-mode
to enable it.

Features:
=========

haskell-doc distinguishes between several different kinds of Haskell ids
and shows information depending on this kind:
 prelude fcts, library fcts ... show the type
 local fcts  ... show the type; must be given a type starting in column 0;
		 this uses the `imenu' package and therefore just works 
		 in `hugs-mode' for the moment -- sorry Graeme
 global fcts ... show the type; there's only rudimentary support for this;
                 it loads all imported modules into emacs buffers and uses
		 the `imenu' information to look-up types (again, hugs-mode
		 only)
 strategy fcts and types ... show the type; strategies are our technique
			     for parallel Haskell programming; if you're
			     not interested in that you can safely turn it off
 Haskell keywords ... show a short summary of its syntax
 user defined ids ... you can specify an association list of ids and 
		      related documentation e.g.:
			(setq haskell-doc-show-user-defined t)
			(setq haskell-doc-user-defined-ids 
			  (list 
			    '("main" . "just another pathetic main function")
                            '("foo" . "a very dummy name")
                            '("bar" . "another dummy name")))

Currently, only Haskell 1.4 is supported. 

If you use haskell-doc with hugs-mode you'll also get a sub-menu in the
`Hugs' menubar item for turning individual features on or off.

In both hugs- and haskell-mode [mouse-3] is bound to an elisp fct that
looks-up the type of the Haskell function under the mouse.

Compatibility:
==============

haskell-doc 1.3 is known to work under Emacs 19.34, Emacs 20.2 and XEmacs
19.15.  It should work with older Emacs versions, too, but I'm not sure how
far back in time you can go. Let me know if you encounter problems.

haskell-doc has been tested with hugs-mode 0.7 and haskell-mode 0.102.
Note that hugs-mode needs a few changes to run under Emacs 20.2. You have to
download hugs-mode 0.7 from the same dir as haskell-doc to run haskell-doc
under Emacs 20.2.

I haven't tested haskell-doc with all other haskell-modes out there. If you
have problems combining it with your pet mode, please let me know.

Bugs:
=====

If you heavily switch between buffers the demon process sometimes seems to
de-install itself (despite still showing haskell-doc in the mode line).
If this happens check if haskell-doc is active by pressing ESC-/
If it is not, activate it again by pressing CTRL-u CTRL-c CTRL-o

If you find any bugs, want to report compatibilty problems, send praises or
whatever, either use the haskell-doc-submit-bug-report function (part of
the haskell-doc menu) or send it directly to:
	      Hans-Wolfgang Loidl <hwloidl@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>

Finally, I figure this mode should be most useful to people just starting
to learn Haskell, who are probably not on this mailing list. So, by all
means, feel free to distribute it to people interested in using it!

Have fun!
