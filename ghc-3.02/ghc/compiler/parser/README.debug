If you want to debug...

* the lexer:

    run "flex" with the -d flag; compile as normal thereafter

* the parser:

    compile hsparser.tab.c and main.c with EXTRA_CC_OPTS=-DHSP_DEBUG

    run hsp with -D; it's dumping the output into *stdout*,
    so you have to do something weird to look at it.
