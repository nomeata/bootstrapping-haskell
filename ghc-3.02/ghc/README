This is version 3.02 of the Glorious Glasgow Haskell compilation
system (GHC).  GHC 3.02 is a compiler for Haskell 1.4.

Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.
Haskell 1.4 is the current version of the language, released in 
April 1997.  The language definition is on the Web at
http://www.haskell.org/report/index.html.

GHC documentation of interest:

* docs/installing.{dvi,info,html}: How to configure, build, and
  install the system.

  The document, as with many others, is in TeX-produced DVI format
  (.dvi suffix), or GNU Info format (.info); the latter is close to
  plain ASCII, if that's what you want.

* ghc/docs/users_guide/user.{dvi,info,html}: How to use GHC; e.g., what
  options are available, how to cope with common problems, how to use
  the profiling facilities, etc.

We welcome your comments and suggestions about this software!  Please
do not suffer or grumble in silence.  The "bug reports" section of the
User's Guide (docs/users_guide/user.{dvi,info,html}) says what we
would like to know when you report a problem.
