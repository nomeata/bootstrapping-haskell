% NOTE TO MAINTAINERS: the way these notes are organized:
%   (1) What's new in the current release
%   (2) What's next ("real soon now")
%   (3) What was new in previous releases (reverse chronological order)
%   (4) anything else
%
% Remember: this isn't the compiler documentation! -- it's just
% pointers to it.  Mentioning something in the release notes is not
% the same as documenting it.
