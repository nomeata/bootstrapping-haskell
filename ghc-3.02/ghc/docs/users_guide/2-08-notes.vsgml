<sect1>Release notes for version~2.08---10/97
<label id="release-2-08">
<p>

GHC 2.08 is a minor upgrade of GHC 2.07, and is released as source only.  It represents work done through September '97.

Here's a list of the changes made since GHC 2.07:

<itemize>

<item> removed deforester from source tree, including the @{-# DEFOREST #-}@
  pragma.  This stuff didn't work anymore, so there was no point
  leaving it hanging around.  If someone wants to pick it up again,
  the source can be checked out of the repository.

<item> documentation is now built automatically for binary distributions

<item> fixed several bugs affecting binary distributions.

<item> fixed bug in Regex.lhs causing random segmentation faults.

<item> a couple of changes to the simplifier means that binary sizes should
  be (very slightly) smaller.

<item> fixed a problem with error messages not being as accurate as they used to 
  be.

<item> fixed a problem with ticky-ticky profiling (symptom: compiling modules
  with -ticky gave lots of parse errors from the C compiler).

<item> added support for @unmapMiddleStackPage@ on cygwin32.

<item> fixed a divide-by-zero problem in the GC statistics code.

</itemize>

The following changes were made to Happy:

<itemize>
<item> bug fixed in state generation.

<item> happy now reports the number of unused rules and terminals in the
  grammar, and lists which ones are unused in the info file.

<item> happy now tries to avoid generating fully overlapped patterns.

<item> bug fixed in lexer: line numbers weren't being counted for @--@
  commented lines.
</itemize>
