Changes made since 2.09:

<itemize>

<item> export some missing operations from @ST@/@LazyST@.

<item> remove wired-in @runST@ from the compiler, move @runST@ from
@STBase@ to @UnsafeST@ and give it a type signature.  Fix a bug in the
compiler to do with universal quantification so this actually works.

<item> fix cut-n-paste-o in @PosixUtils.lhs@.

<item> better code for checking for overlapping(incomplete?) patterns.

<item> @-fwarn-simple-patterns@ for pattern-bindings that could fail.

<item> win32 green-card stubs imported.

<item> fix 'make carries on after errors' problem <em>again</em>.

<item> driver fixed to be perl4 compatible again.

<item> obscure happy bug fixed.

<item> @Word@ removed from hbc library to avoid conflicts.

<item> lots of fixes to the binary distribution system - you can now do
@gmake binary-dist Project=Happy@ from the top-level and get a Happy
binary distribution.  GHC binary distributions no longer contain
Happy.  

<item> add some suffix rules for SGML, we can use SGML-Tools for
documentation now.

<item> added an new manual for Happy, in SGML format.

<item> added the GHC/Hugs extension library documentation as a separate
document, and removed that information from the Users' Guide.

<item> Fixed a bug where ':::' wasn't being parsed properly in interface files.

<item> Fixed a long-standing bug in the strictness analyser.

<item> Fixed the cause of the @getWorkerIdAndCons@ panic.

<item> Moved the array tests from ghc/lib into the test framework.
ghc/lib/tests now doesn't exist.

</itemize>
