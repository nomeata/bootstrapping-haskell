<sect1>Release notes for version~3-02---4/97

Changes made since 3.01:

<itemize>

<item> CharLike and IntLike closures fixed (should reduce allocation
slightly).

<item> Pattern binding desugaring improved to eliminate intermediate
tuples in some cases.

<item> Fixed parsing problem: declaring a record with an infix constructor.

<item> When computing the Makefile dependencies, using either
<tt/ghc -M/ (preferred) or by invoking the <tt/mkdependHS/ script
directly, <tt/CPP/ will now by default not be run over the input
files. To have CPP wash your input files, use the command-line option
<tt/-cpp/.

<item> Added a working specialiser.

<item> Added <tt/unsafeCoerce#/.

<item> Fixed compilation of real floating-point literals: they were
previously generated as applications of <tt/fromRational/, even when
not overloaded.

<item> The object splitter had a bug in it that increased binary sizes
significantly on i386-unknown-linux and sparc-sun-solaris2.  Now
fixed.

<item> Bump some of the constants that affect unfolding agression:
performance is now better than 2.10, and binary sizes are smaller.

<item> Add NOINLINE pragma, and use it for unsafePerformIO and
friends.  Remove PrelUnsafe and PrelUnsafeST, move the contents into
PrelIOBase and PrelST respectively.  Add NOINLINE pragma to
LazyST.runST.

</itemize>
