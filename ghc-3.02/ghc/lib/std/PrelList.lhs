\subsection{The zip family}

zip takes two lists and returns a list of corresponding pairs.  If one
input list is short, excess elements of the longer list are discarded.
zip3 takes three lists and returns a list of triples.  Zips for larger
tuples are in the List library

\begin{code}
zip                     :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
-- Specification

-- The zipWith family generalises the zip family by zipping with the
-- function given as the first argument, instead of a tupling function.
-- For example, zipWith (+) is applied to two lists to produce the list
-- of corresponding sums.

zipWith                 :: (a->b->c) -> [a]->[b]->[c]
zipWith z (a:as) (b:bs) =  z a b : zipWith z as bs

\subsection{Functions on strings}
%*							*
%*********************************************************

lines breaks a string up into a list of strings at newline characters.
The resulting strings do not contain newlines.  Similary, words
breaks a string up into a list of words, which were delimited by
white space.  unlines and unwords are the inverse operations.
unlines joins lines with terminating newlines, and unwords joins
words with separating spaces.

\begin{code}
lines			:: String -> [String]
lines ""		=  []
lines s			=  let (l, s') = break (== '\n') s

					[]     	-> []

				      where (w, s'') = 
                                             break {-partain:Char.-}isSpace s'

unlines			:: [String] -> String
#ifdef USE_REPORT_PRELUDE

#else
-- HBC version (stolen)

Common up near identical calls to `error' to reduce the number
constant strings created when compiled:

 error (prel_list_str ++ fun ++ ": negative index")

prel_list_str = "PreludeList."
