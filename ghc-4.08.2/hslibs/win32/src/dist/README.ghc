* Win32 libraries for ghc-2.10

To use the Win32 libs with ghc-2.10, you'll
need to do the following:

 - unpack/install distribution on top of
   your current ghc-2.10 tree.
 - apply the patch "ghc-win32.patch" and
   re-run "make in-place", i.e.,
   
   foo% cd /to/the/top/of/ghc/bin/dist/tree
   foo% ( cd bin/i386-unknown-cygwin32/ghc-2.10/ ; patch < ../../../ghc-win32.patch )
   foo% make in-place
