<h1 align=center>Edison: A Library of Efficient Data Structures</h1>
<h2 align=center>(Haskell Version 1.0)</h2>

<p>
I am pleased to release a library of efficient data structures for
Haskell, named <dfn>Edison</dfn> both in honor of Thomas Alva Edison
and for the mnemonic value of <strong>ED</strong>i<strong>S</strong>on
(<strong>E</strong>fficient <strong>D</strong>ata
<strong>S</strong>tructures).  I intend to eventually release a
version of the library for Standard ML.  Other future possibilities
include O'Caml, Scheme, and Java.
</p>

<p>
The intention of the library is to provide several families of
abstractions, each with multiple implementations, along with guidance
on how to choose the best implementation for your particular
application.  The families of abstractions I have in mind initially
are sequences, finite maps, priority queues, and sets/bags.
</p>

<p>
Note that, in its current state, the library is mostly a framework.
That is, I provide signatures, but not yet very many implementations.
I intend to populate this framework over time, adding a new module
every few weeks.  Thus, the library is extremely unstable in the sense
that I will continually be modifying existing data structures and
adding new ones.  However, I hope that the signatures will remain
fairly stable over time, making these changes to the implementations
mostly transparent to users of the library.
