<IndexTerm><Primary>GlaExts interface (GHC extensions)</Primary></IndexTerm>
The <Literal>GlaExts</Literal> interface provides access to extensions that only GHC
implements.  These currently are: unboxed types, including the
representations of the primitive types (Int, Float, etc.), and the
GHC primitive operations (<Function>+&num;</Function>, <Function>==&num;</Function>, etc.).

This module used to provide access to all the Glasgow extensions, but
these have since been moved into separate libraries for compatibility
with Hugs (version 2.09: in fact, you can still get at this stuff via
<Literal>GlaExts</Literal> for compatibility, but this facility will likely be removed
in the future).

-- the representation of some basic types:
data Char    = C# Char#
data Int     = I# Int#
data Addr    = A# Addr#
data Word    = W# Word#
data Float   = F# Float#
data Double  = D# Double#
data Integer = S# Int#              -- small integers
             | J# Int# ByteArray#   -- large integers

module GHC  -- all primops and primitive types.
