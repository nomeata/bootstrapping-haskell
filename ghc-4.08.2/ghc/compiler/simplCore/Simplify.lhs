\end{code}

The reason for this OutExprStuff stuff is that we want to float *after*
simplifying a RHS, not before.  If we do so naively we get quadratic
behaviour as things float out.

To see why it's important to do it after, consider this (real) example:

	let t = f x
	in fst t
==>
	let t = let a = e1
		    b = e2
		in (a,b)
	in fst t
==>
	let a = e1
	    b = e2
	    t = (a,b)
	in
	a	-- Can't inline a this round, cos it appears twice
==>
	e1

Each of the ==> steps is a round of simplification.  We'd save a
whole round if we float first.  This can cascade.  Consider

	let f = g d
	in \x -> ...f...
==>
	let f = let d1 = ..d.. in \y -> e
	in \x -> ...f...
==>
	let d1 = ..d..
	in \x -> ...(\y ->e)...

Only in this second round can the \y be applied, and it 
might do the same again.

--	 Comments about the InlineMe case 
--	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- Don't inline in the RHS of something that has an
-- inline pragma.  But be careful that the InScopeEnv that
-- we return does still have inlinings on!
-- 
-- It really is important to switch off inlinings.  This function
-- may be inlinined in other modules, so we don't want to remove
-- (by inlining) calls to functions that have specialisations, or
-- that may have transformation rules in an importing scope.
-- E.g. 	{-# INLINE f #-}
-- 		f x = ...g...
-- and suppose that g is strict *and* has specialisations.
-- If we inline g's wrapper, we deny f the chance of getting
-- the specialised version of g when f is inlined at some call site
-- (perhaps in some other module).

-- It's also important not to inline a worker back into a wrapper.
-- A wrapper looks like
--	wraper = inline_me (\x -> ...worker... )
-- Normally, the inline_me prevents the worker getting inlined into
-- the wrapper (initially, the worker's only call site!).  But,
-- if the wrapper is sure to be called, the strictness analyser will
-- mark it 'demanded', so when the RHS is simplified, it'll get an ArgOf
-- continuation.  That's why the keep_inline predicate returns True for
-- ArgOf continuations.  It shouldn't do any harm not to dissolve the
-- inline-me note under these circumstances

\subsection{Decisions about inlining}

%************************************************************************

NB: At one time I tried not pre/post-inlining top-level things,
even if they occur exactly once.  Reason: 
	(a) some might appear as a function argument, so we simply
		replace static allocation with dynamic allocation:
		   l = <...>
		   x = f x
	becomes
		   x = f <...>

	(b) some top level things might be black listed

HOWEVER, I found that some useful foldr/build fusion was lost (most
notably in spectral/hartel/parstof) because the foldr didn't see the build.

Doing the dynamic allocation isn't a big deal, in fact, but losing the
fusion can be.

\begin{code}
preInlineUnconditionally :: Bool {- Black listed -} -> InId -> Bool
	-- Examines a bndr to see if it is used just once in a 
	-- completely safe way, so that it is safe to discard the binding
	-- inline its RHS at the (unique) usage site, REGARDLESS of how
	-- big the RHS might be.  If this is the case we don't simplify
	-- the RHS first, but just inline it un-simplified.
	--
	-- This is much better than first simplifying a perhaps-huge RHS
	-- and then inlining and re-simplifying it.
	--
	-- NB: we don't even look at the RHS to see if it's trivial
	-- We might have
	--			x = y
	-- where x is used many times, but this is the unique occurrence
	-- of y.  We should NOT inline x at all its uses, because then
	-- we'd do the same for y -- aargh!  So we must base this
	-- pre-rhs-simplification decision solely on x's occurrences, not
	-- on its rhs.
	-- 
	-- Evne RHSs labelled InlineMe aren't caught here, because
	-- there might be no benefit from inlining at the call site.

preInlineUnconditionally black_listed bndr
  | black_listed || opt_SimplNoPreInlining = False
  | otherwise = case idOccInfo bndr of
	  	  OneOcc in_lam once -> not in_lam && once
			-- Not inside a lambda, one occurrence ==> safe!

	-- We're at the binding site right now, and

	-- Don't inline even WHNFs inside lambdas; doing so may

	-- This isn't the last chance; see NOTE above.
	--
	-- NB: Even inline pragmas (e.g. IMustBeINLINEd) are ignored here
	-- Why?  Because we don't even want to inline them into the
	-- RHS of constructor arguments. See NOTE above
	--
	-- NB: Even NOINLINEis ignored here: if the rhs is trivial

Case elimination [see the code above]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Start with a simple situation:

	case x# of	===>   e[x#/y#]
	  y# -> e

(when x#, y# are of primitive type, of course).  We can't (in general)
do this for algebraic cases, because we might turn bottom into
non-bottom!

Actually, we generalise this idea to look for a case where we're
scrutinising a variable, and we know that only the default case can
match.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
	case x of
	  0#    -> ...
	  other -> ...(case x of
			 0#    -> ...
			 other -> ...) ...
\end{code}
Here the inner case can be eliminated.  This really only shows up in
eliminating error-checking code.

We also make sure that we deal with this very common case:

 	case e of 
	  x -> ...x...

Here we are using the case as a strict let; if x is used only once
then we want to inline it.  We have to be careful that this doesn't 
make the program terminate when it would have diverged before, so we
check that 
	- x is used strictly, or
	- e is already evaluated (it may so if e is a variable)

Lastly, we generalise the transformation to handle this:

	case e of	===> r
	   True  -> r
	   False -> r

We only do this for very cheaply compared r's (constructors, literals
and variables).  If pedantic bottoms is on, we only do it when the
scrutinee is a PrimOp which can't fail.

We do it *here*, looking at un-simplified alternatives, because we
have to check that r doesn't mention the variables bound by the
pattern in each alternative, so the binder-info is rather useful.

So the case-elimination algorithm is:

	1. Eliminate alternatives which can't match

	2. Check whether all the remaining alternatives
		(a) do not mention in their rhs any of the variables bound in their pattern
	   and  (b) have equal rhss

	3. Check we can safely ditch the case:
		   * PedanticBottoms is off,
		or * the scrutinee is an already-evaluated variable
		or * the scrutinee is a primop which is ok for speculation
			-- ie we want to preserve divide-by-zero errors, and
			-- calls to error itself!

		or * [Prim cases] the scrutinee is a primitive variable

		or * [Alg cases] the scrutinee is a variable and
		     either * the rhs is the same variable
			(eg case x of C a b -> x  ===>   x)
		     or     * there is only one alternative, the default alternative,
				and the binder is used strictly in its scope.
				[NB this is helped by the "use default binder where
				 possible" transformation; see below.]


If so, then we can replace the case with one of the rhss.

\end{code}

simplCaseBinder checks whether the scrutinee is a variable, v.
If so, try to eliminate uses of v in the RHSs in favour of case_bndr; 
that way, there's a chance that v will now only be used once, and hence inlined.

There is a time we *don't* want to do that, namely when -fno-case-of-case
is on.  This happens in the first simplifier pass, and enhances full laziness.
Here's the bad case:
	f = \ y -> ...(case x of I# v -> ...(case x of ...) ... )
If we eliminate the inner case, we trap it inside the I# v -> arm,
which might prevent some full laziness happening.  I've seen this
in action in spectral/cichelli/Prog.hs:
	 [(m,n) | m <- [1..max], n <- [1..max]]
Hence the no_case_of_case argument


If we do this, then we have to nuke any occurrence info (eg IAmDead)
in the case binder, because the case-binder now effectively occurs
whenever v does.  AND we have to do the same for the pattern-bound
variables!  Example:

	(case x of { (a,b) -> a }) (case x of { (p,q) -> q })

Here, b and p are dead.  But when we move the argment inside the first
case RHS, and eliminate the second case, we get

	case x or { (a,b) -> a b }

Urk! b is alive!  Reason: the scrutinee was a variable, and case elimination
happened.  Hence the zap_occ_info function returned by simplCaseBinder

\begin{code}
simplCaseBinder no_case_of_case (Var v) case_bndr thing_inside
  | not no_case_of_case
  = simplBinder (zap case_bndr)					$ \ case_bndr' ->
    modifyInScope v case_bndr'					$
	-- We could extend the substitution instead, but it would be
	-- a hack because then the substitution wouldn't be idempotent
	-- any more (v is an OutId).  And this just just as well.
    thing_inside case_bndr' zap
  where
    zap b = b `setIdOccInfo` NoOccInfo
	    
simplCaseBinder add_eval_info other_scrut case_bndr thing_inside
  = simplBinder case_bndr 		$ \ case_bndr' ->
    thing_inside case_bndr' (\ bndr -> bndr)	-- NoOp on bndr
\end{code}

prepareCaseAlts does two things:

1.  Remove impossible alternatives

2.  If the DEFAULT alternative can match only one possible constructor,
    then make that constructor explicit.
    e.g.
	case e of x { DEFAULT -> rhs }
     ===>
	case e of x { (a,b) -> rhs }
    where the type is a single constructor type.  This gives better code
    when rhs also scrutinises x or e.
