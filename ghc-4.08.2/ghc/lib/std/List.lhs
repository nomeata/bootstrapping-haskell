@mapAccumL@ behaves like a combination
of  @map@ and @foldl@;
it applies a function to each element of a list, passing an accumulating
parameter from left to right, and returning a final value of this
accumulator together with the new list.

\begin{code}

mapAccumL :: (acc -> x -> (acc, y)) -- Function of elt of input list
				    -- and accumulator, returning new
				    -- accumulator and elt of result list
   	  -> acc	    -- Initial accumulator 
	  -> [x]	    -- Input list
	  -> (acc, [y])	    -- Final accumulator and result list
mapAccumL _ s []     	=  (s, [])
mapAccumL f s (x:xs) 	=  (s'',y:ys)
		           where (s', y ) = f s x
			         (s'',ys) = mapAccumL f s' xs
\end{code}

@mapAccumR@ does the same, but working from right to left instead.  Its type is
the same as @mapAccumL@, though.

\begin{code}
mapAccumR :: (acc -> x -> (acc, y)) 	-- Function of elt of input list
					-- and accumulator, returning new
					-- accumulator and elt of result list
	    -> acc 		-- Initial accumulator
	    -> [x] 		-- Input list
	    -> (acc, [y])		-- Final accumulator and result list
mapAccumR _ s []     	=  (s, [])
mapAccumR f s (x:xs)	=  (s'', y:ys)
