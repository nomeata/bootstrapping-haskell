<sect1>Release notes for version~4.03---3/99

<itemize>
<item> <tt/Weak/ library changes:
        <itemize>
        <item> Finalise is now spelt finalize in all function names.
        <item> <tt/finalize/ now runs the finalizer immediately, and
               waits for it to complete before returning.
        <item> <tt/mkWeak/ now takes a <tt/Maybe (IO ())/ for the finalizer,
               and <tt/mkWeakNoFinalizer/ is removed.
        </itemize>

<item> Changed representation of <tt/Integer/ type to speed up
computations on small integers.  The performance of <tt/Integer/ is now
only slightly slower than <tt/Int/ for values between <tt/minBound :: Int/
and <tt/maxBound :: Int/.

<item> On Win32 platforms, added support for using (and producing) dynamic
link libraries (DLLs) containing ghc-compiled code.

<item> Added <tt>-funbox-strict-fields</tt> for unboxing/unpacking strict
constructor fields.

</itemize>
