<sect1>Release notes for version~4.02---12/98
<label id="release-4-02">
<p>

<itemize>

<item> Full Haskell 98 language support.

<item> Scoped type variables implemented (see Section <ref
name="Scoped Type Variables" id="scoped-type-variables">).

<item> Several bugs in _ccall_GC and foreign export fixed.

<item> Warnings for unused variables should work now (they didn't before).

<item> Simplifier improvements:
   <itemize>
        <item> Much better treatment of strict arguments.
        <item> Function arguments of unlifted type are treated as strict.
        <item> Better treatment of bottoming Ids.
        <item> No need for worker/wrapper split for fns that are merely strict.
        <item> Fewer iterations needed, I hope.
   </itemize>

<item> Strictness of primitive operations is now explicit and used by
the simplifier.

<item> Less gratuitous renaming in interface files and abs C.

<item> <tt/OccName/ is a separate module, and is an abstract data type.
 
<item> A new generational garbage collector: the number of generations
is variable, using the -G RTS option (see <ref id="rts-options-gc"
name="RTS options to control the garbage-collector">).  This collector
is faster and more space-efficient than the two-space collector in 4.01.

<item> Error messages and warnings are now printed out in the order they
occur in the source code.

<item> <tt/isEmptyMVar/ operation added to the <tt/Concurrent/ library.

<item> Two new functions exported from <tt/ST/ (and <tt/LazyST/):
<tt/unsafeIOToST/ and <tt/stToIO/.

<item> The <tt/+RTS -H&lt;size&gt;/ option is reinstated.  Now it
means "use about this much memory" (see Section <ref
id="rts-options-gc" name="RTS options to control the garbage
collector">).  This option was added mainly so that 4.02 GC times look
good compared to 3.02 :-).

<item> <tt/finalise/ and <tt/mkWeakNoFinaliser/ operations added to
<tt/Weak/ library.

<item> Ticky-ticky profiling works again (cost-centre profiling is
still broken).

<item> Better <tt/egcs-1.1.1/ support.

</itemize>
