This is the root directory for functional-programming tools
distributed by the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University.
Simon Peyton Jones <simonpj@microsoft.com> is the ringleader of this
effort.  The tools are:

    ghc		the Glasgow Haskell compilation system
    hslibs	collection of Haskell libraries
    haggis	the Haggis GUI toolkit
    happy	the Happy Haskell parser generator
    hdirect     Haskell interop tool
    green-card	a foreign function interface pre-processor for Haskell.
    nofib	the NoFib Haskell benchmarking suite
    literate	the Glasgow "literate programming" system
    glafp-utils shared utility programs
    mk	        GNU make setup used by all of fptools
    docs        documentation on the installing and using
                the fptools suite.

Components which are always part of a distribution (never stand-alone)
are "glafp-utils" and "mk" (a configuration system).

Quick start:  the following is *supposed* to work

	$ ./configure
	$ make boot
	$ make
	$ make install

where 'make' is whatever GNU make is called on your system.  The
configuration script is a standard GNU autoconf script which accepts
all the normal arguments, eg. --prefix=<blah> to install the package
somewhere other than /usr/local.  Try ./configure --help to get a full
list of the options.

There is usually an ANNOUNCE* file with any distribution.  Please
consult that, or the <piece>/README file, to find out how to proceed.
